## INGREDIENTS: 🍲🍲🍲

* 1.5 kg of rump steak in steaks
500 g of paris mushrooms
* 2 onions
* 3 cloves of garlic
* 3 cups of fresh cream (about 750 ml)
* 3 tablespoons of tomato paste
* 3 tablespoons homemade ketchup
* 3 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce
* 3 tablespoons of cognac
* 4 tablespoons of olive oil
* salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

## PREPARATION MODE: 👨‍🍳👨‍🍳👨‍🍳

* Cut the steaks into strips (5 cm x 2 cm), transfer to a bowl and keep at room temperature – the meat cannot be cold when browning. Meanwhile, prepare the other ingredients.
* On a cutting board, cut the paris mushrooms into 3 slices and set aside (if you prefer, you can use canned mushrooms, but the result will not be the same). Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic.
* Place a medium saucepan over medium heat. When hot, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil and brown the strips of meat little by little – if you put them all together, they will release their own liquid and steam instead of browning. Turn with tongs to brown evenly.
* Transfer the golden strips to a bowl. Brown the rest, always basting the pan with a little oil before each batch.
* Lower the heat of the pan to low and drizzle with 1 more tablespoon (soup) of oil. Add the onion and sauté until wilted for about 3 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pan well – the meat burns will add flavor to the preparation. Add the garlic * * and stir for just 1 minute to fragrant.
Add the tomato paste, ketchup and mix well. Return the browned meat to the pan, add the Worcestershire sauce and the brandy. Add the mushrooms and mix gently.
* Drizzle with the cream, season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix well and cook over medium heat. Once it starts to boil, cook for another 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens. Turn off the heat and serve next.
